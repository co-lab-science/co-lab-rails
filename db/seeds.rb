These authors publish a series of papers in The Lancet breaking-down this substantial figure into sources of waste scientists find themselves all too familiar with. At Co-Lab, we believe these sources of waste are downstream effects of the traditional grant-based scientific economy. Grants result in perverse incentives for researchers that reduce the quality of research and efficiency of the scientific spending in the modern era of the internet. \n\tCo-Lab leverages the internet to provide an incentive structure that maximizes the efficiency of scientific spending. We host an open database of experimental data from which any user can observe, question, hypothesize, or criticize. We rank users based on the impact of their contributions to science, and financially compensate them accordingly. Most importantly, all of the content created on Co-Lab will be free to access for all. This results in a scientific economy that is inherently collaborative and will maximize the efficiency of scientific spending and the output of the scientific economy."
