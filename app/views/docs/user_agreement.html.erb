      <p><strong>General</strong></p>
      <p>The Website is hosted in the United States. The Operators make no claims that the Content on the Website is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States. Access to the Content may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Website from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. The provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms.

Notice shall be deemed given upon personal delivery or facsimile, or, if sent by certified mail with postage prepaid, 5 business days after the date of mailing, or, if sent by international overnight courier with postage prepaid, 7 business days after the date of mailing. If any provision herein is held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force without being affected in any way. Further, the parties agree to replace such unenforceable provision with an enforceable provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the unenforceable provision. Section headings are for reference purposes only and do not define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. The failure of the Operators to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit the Operators' rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.

These Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement of the parties, and supersedes any and all oral or written agreements or understandings between the parties, as to their subject matter. The waiver of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.</p>

      <p><strong>User Guidelines</strong></p>
      <p>Co-Lab.wiki strongly believes in freedom of speech. We have a vast audience spread across many cultures, countries and backgrounds with varying values and our service is designed to let users freely express any ideas and opinions without us censoring or endorsing them. That being said, there are a few categories of content and behavior that we don&rsquo;t permit because we consider them harmful to the community.</p>
      <p>To be transparent about what is and isn&rsquo;t allowed on your site, we&rsquo;ve put together this set of guidelines. The following activity/material isn&rsquo;t allowed on Co-Lab.wiki.</p>
      <p>Illegal content and conduct.</p>
      <p>Self-explanatory.</p>
      <p>Intellectual property infringement.</p>
      <p>Co-Lab.wiki is a publishing, rather than a file sharing platform, so we recognize that copyrighted materials are often used in <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/fair-use/">fair use</a> context. We strongly support this and urge copyright holders to take this into consideration before submitting complaints. If you&rsquo;re not sure, a good rule of thumb is to always ask the rights holder for permission before republishing their content.</p>
      <p><strong>Pornography.</strong></p>
      <p>We know that there may be different definitions of this, but generally, we define pornography as visual depictions of sexually explicit acts. Nudity, in and of itself, is <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/mature-content/">fine</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Technologically harmful content.</strong></p>
      <p>Please don&rsquo;t upload or link to malware, spyware, adware, or other malicious or destructive code.</p>
      <p><strong>Impersonation.</strong></p>
      <p>Don&rsquo;t claim to be a person or organization you&rsquo;re not. </p>
      <p>Directly threatening material.</p>
      <p>Do not post direct and realistic threats of violence. That is, you cannot post a genuine call for violence&mdash;or death&mdash;against an individual person, or groups of persons. </p>
      <p><strong>Posting private information.</strong></p>
      <p>Don&rsquo;t share someone&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/private-information/">personal information</a> without their consent. This includes collecting sensitive information in <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/contact-form/">Contact Forms</a> such as account passwords and credit card numbers, to name a couple.</p>
      <p><strong>Advertising.</strong></p>
      <p><a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/monetize-your-site/#advertising">Advertising</a> isn&rsquo;t permitted. </p>
      <p><strong>Hotlinking to Co-Lab.wiki.</strong></p>
      <p>Your Co-Lab.wiki site shouldn&rsquo;t host files that will only be used on other sites.</p>
      <p><strong>Spam or machine-generated content.</strong></p>
      <p>You know what this is, but in general, sites such as those primarily dedicated to drive traffic to third party sites, boost SEO, phish, spoof, or promote affiliate marketing aren&rsquo;t cool. We don&rsquo;t want you to pollute the web outside of Co-Lab.wiki either, so we ask you to please avoid sending unwanted or unsolicited promotions or emails about your site, even if it&rsquo;s not on Co-Lab.wiki.</p>
      <p>Bear in mind that these are just guidelines &mdash; interpretations are solely up to us. These guidelines are not exhaustive and are subject to change.</p>
      <p>If you believe a Co-Lab.wiki site has violated our <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tos">Terms of Service</a> or any of these policies, please <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/">report the site</a>. We aim to promptly review and investigate all complaints that we receive, but if and how we respond will depend on a variety of factors, such as the information available to us and the type of violation. We may also contact the site owner to inform him/her of the complaint.</p>
      <p>If we&rsquo;re not in a position to make a determination (for example, whether something is <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/defamation/">defamatory</a> or not), we defer to the judgment of a court.<br /><br /></p>
      <strong>Thanks to <a href="https://en.wordpress.com/tos/">automattic </a>and <a href="http://forum-template.wikidot.com/legal:terms-of-use">wikidot.com</a> for sharing their user agreements under creative commons sharealike 3.0 agreements. </strong>
